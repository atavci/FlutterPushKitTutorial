# flutter_push_kit_tutorial

An example project that shows how to use Huawei Push Kit Plugin for Flutter.

The tutorial is on [this medium post](https://medium.com/huawei-developers/sending-push-notifications-on-flutter-with-huawei-push-kit-plugin-534787862b4d) please check it first.

## Notes before building

I removed the agconnect-services.json and key.properties files for obvious reasons. Add your versions of these files (you can refer to the medium post) and then you can run the app by following commands:

Get the dependencies:

`flutter pub get`

Build&Run the application

`flutter run`
